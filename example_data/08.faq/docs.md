This is the responsibility of the IntAc Student Success Managers! -> We can forwardthe students to booking an appointment (they should know how to do that) or write an email to <mailto:masters@academy.rwth-aachen.de>.

RWTHonline Robotic Systems engineering Tree is always the binding reference!

_Suggested_ order of courses:
- 1st Semester
    - Compulsory
        - Robotic Systems
        - Advanced Robotic Kinematics and Dynamics
        - Linear Control Systems
        - Machine Learning
        - Fundamentals of Machine Learning
    - Electives
        - Recommended: German Language Course
        - max. 1 elective
- 2nd Semester
    - Compulsory
        - Computer Vision
        - Multibody Dynamics

        - Electives to get to ~30 CP
- 3rd Semester
    - Compulsory
        - Robotic Sensor Systems
        - Simulation of Robotic Systems, Sensors and Environment
    - Electives
        - Electives to get to ~30 CP
    - Possibly Internship / Reserach Project (more likely in 4th)

**How many courses shall I take in one semester?**

This is the responsibility of the IntAc Student Success Managers! -> We can forward them to booking an appointment (they should know how to do that) or write an email to <mailto:masters@academy.rwth-aachen.de>.

The goal CP count for one semetser is 30 CP.
At the same time you should make sure to have a maximum of 6 exams in one semester.

In that regard, also keep in mind possible prep courses that you might need to write.
(Info: prep courses must be passed in order to the start the master tesis)

**How long will my Curriculum Change Request take to be processed?**

It will take approximately 10-14 days for us to process your Curriculum Change Request. After that, we will forward your request to the ZPA where the processing time might also take up to two weeks.

Thus, it is important - and your responsibility! - to send us your request in reasonable time before the end of the examination registration period.

----------------------------------

**What formal requirements do I have to keep in mind when writing my Internship Report?**

Here are some key aspects of what we expect from your internship report:

You have to include the internship front page of IGMR as the first page of your report.

Further, the report should at least be 24 pages long - excluding pictures, reference lists, and the table of content. 
For instance, you start your internship on July 1st, 2023, and finish it after 12 weeks on September 23rd, 2023. For every week of your internship you will need to write approximately 2 pages which adds up to 2x12= 24 written (!) pages in total. 

At the end you should add a critical review reflecting on your overall experience during your internship.

You also need to add a Certificate of the company you did your internship in - however, the certfificate should not be included in your report but rather has to be sent to us as a seperate pdf.

If there´s any uncertainties, take a look at your examination regulations [](https://masters.academy-rwth.de/robosys/)
where you can find more information concerning the internship in general.

***************************


**I am planning to write my masters thesis externally. What are the requirements for finding an internal supervisor?**

Any institute that is a [faculty 4 institute](https://www.maschinenbau.rwth-aachen.de/cms/Maschinenbau/forschung/Einrichten/~zxfwd/Institute-und-Lehrstuehle-der-Fakultaet/?idx=1) will be able to supervise you internally.

Further, if an institute offers a module in the standard Curriculum of Robotic Systems Engineering, this institute can also be selected as your internal supervisor, even if it is not a faculty 4 institute. - Modules that you have added to your Curriculum via a Curriculum Change Request do NOT count into that!

If you are not sure which modules are offered by which institutes, you can look it up in the module description on [RWTH Online](https://online.rwth-aachen.de/RWTHonline/ee/ui/ca2/app/desktop/#/login).

*********************************

**What do I need to know regarding supervisors and assistants?**

- Supervising professor --> Prof. of RWTH Institutes that is part of faculty 4 or part of your curriculum (internal supervisor)

- Supervising research assistant --> responsible research assistant of the same RWTH Institute

- External Supervisor --> only for external thesis at a company or research institute that is not part of faculty 4 or your curriculum.

**I want to add a module to my Curriculum, but I don´t know how.**

Please fill out the [Curriculum Change](https://www.maschinenbau.rwth-aachen.de/cms/Maschinenbau/studium/Studierende/Antraege/~fhbb/Studienplanaenderung/) and send it to <mailto:robosys@igmr.rwth-aachen.de>

**Any genereal questions regarding Robotic Systems Engineering M.Sc.**


Here are some helpful links to any questions and topics that may arise during your studies:


This is the official website of the [International Academy](https://www.academy.rwth-aachen.de/en/programs/masters-degree-programs)

Here´s a link to your [examination regulations](https://masters.academy-rwth.de/robosys/)

**I want my language course to be credited. Whom do I have to contact?**

Plase contact your corresponding person at the [examination office](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/root/studium/Im-Studium/Pruefungen-Abschlussarbeiten/~cbcn/Kontakte-im-ZPA-nach-Sachgebieten/?search=Robotic%20Systems%20Engineering&lidx=1).

*************************************

**I sent a Curriculum Change Request to add a module to my Curriculum, but it got rejected.**

It is certainly frustrating when a module you wished to take gets rejected.

We always take a lot of time and consideration when deciding whether a module will be an option for a Curriculum Change Request. 

If we eventually decide a module is not suitable, it is because this module is not fitting for the overall goal of the Robotic Systems Engineering degree. 
We do not take this decision arbitrarily but try to make it fair and uniform for everyone. 

************************************

**I want to apply for a scholarship and need a recommendation letter. What documents and information do you require from me?**

We will need different kinds of information to evaluate whether we can issue a recommendation letter for you:


1. Tell us in which batch/ year you started your studies so we can calculate the average study length of your batch.

2. Provide a current transcript of records displaying your grades.

3. Give us some insight on when you are planning to finish your studies - you do not need a specific document for this, just explain in one or two sentences so we are able to get a better picture on this.

4. Write to the following mail: bescheinigung@fb4.rwth-aachen.de and ask for a document ranking your academic performance among your fellow students.

5. If you have any extracurricular or working experience, feel free to include this in your request and keep in mind to send some kind of certificate/ contract to confirm this.


After receiving all necessary details, you will hear from us latest 7-10 days.
